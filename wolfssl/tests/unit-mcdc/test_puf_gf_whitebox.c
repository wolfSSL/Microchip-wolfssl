/*
 * MC/DC white-box supplement for wolfcrypt/src/puf.c -- the GF(2^7) helper.
 *
 * Closes puf.c 123:0, the last open condition in the module:
 *
 *     static WC_INLINE byte gf_mul(byte a, byte b)
 *     {
 *         if (a == 0 || b == 0)
 *             return 0;
 *
 * `a == 0`'s independence pair needs the decision's TRUE outcome with `a` the
 * deciding operand -- i.e. a == 0 -- beside the all-false row. The BCH decoder
 * that reaches gf_mul() only multiplies syndrome/locator coefficients it has
 * already tested for zero, so every call the KAT makes arrives with both
 * operands non-zero and the decision is constant false. gf_mul() is
 * file-static, so no caller outside puf.c can supply the missing row: it takes
 * a TU that #includes puf.c.
 *
 * That is what this driver is. It rides the m33mu lane's white-box mechanism
 * (variant "lane_whitebox"; lanes/m33mu/entry.sh + harness/build-fw.sh WB_SRC
 * mode relink the firmware with puf.c's object replaced by this TU and main()
 * routed here), which is also why it could not exist before: the lane's only
 * driver used to be tests/unit-mcdc/test_puf_whitebox.c riding along as an
 * UNinstrumented lane_extra_source, and that one can only call puf.c's public
 * entry points.
 *
 * Three vectors, all in this one binary and all pure table arithmetic with no
 * state, no allocation and no I/O:
 *   (a == 0, b != 0)  -> decision true on the first operand
 *   (a != 0, b == 0)  -> decision true on the second (already covered, kept so
 *                        the pair is complete inside this binary)
 *   (a != 0, b != 0)  -> the all-false row
 * The same three are issued against gf_inv()'s single-condition guard so its
 * zero arm is exercised here too.
